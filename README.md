# Perfume-Recommender-System

There are a lot of perfume lovers who are trying out new perfume randomly and trying to discover what they might like. As someone like me who spent too much money on buying and trying different perfume, I decided to build my own perfume recommender system.

### Project Goal:
The goal is to help more perfume lovers to try different products and discover their new signature perfume or we can help them to find the dope version of their favorite products with a cheaper price. 

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

- [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
- [chromedriver_binary](https://pypi.org/project/chromedriver-binary/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
